##what is dart?

    dart is a Programming language use to build :
    -mobile apps(flutter)
    -webapps
    -desktop apps
    -backend services

    Today we only care about one thinng: dart is a language that runs instructions **top to bottom**



##How dart runs code

    every dart program start from 
    main()

    if dart cannot find main() it cannot run your program

    example 
    void main(){
        print("hello world");
    }

    -void    ->     this function returns nothing
    -main()  ->  entry point
    -{}      ->       block of code
    -print() ->  outputs text to the console


##STATEMENTS

    eachinstruction in dart ends with a semi colon
     e.i i the example above.
     line 2 of the program -  print("hello world"); if yu forget the ; semicolon dart complains


##STRINGS

    text in dart is called string like in the example above
        "hello world" is a string, 'hello world' also works.
